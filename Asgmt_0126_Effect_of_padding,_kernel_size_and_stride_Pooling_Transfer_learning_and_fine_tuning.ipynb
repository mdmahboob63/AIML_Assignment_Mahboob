        "Ans:When you adjust the padding value in a CNN layer, you are controlling how the convolution operation interacts with the spatial dimensions of the input. More padding means the spatial dimensions are preserved, which can be useful in preventing the loss of information at the borders of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you increase the padding, you may observe that the spatial dimensions of the output feature map remain the same or decrease less than without padding. This can be important in avoiding issues like the vanishing gradient problem and allows the network to learn features from the entire input.\n",
